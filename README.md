3. Write a program to implement the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm on the Iris
 dataset. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the k-NN classifier, and evaluate its
 accuracy

4. Perform binary classification-the model must predict a label that belongs to one of two
 classes.diabetics data set('/kaggle/input/ml-basics-data-files/diabetes.csv').Train a binary
 classifier to predict whether or not a patient should be tested for diabetes based on Some
 medical data.

6. Perform Multiple linear regression to model the relationship between two or more features
 from a dataset (kaggle) and a response by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
